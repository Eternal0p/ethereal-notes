# **App Name**: Ethereal Notes

## Core Features:

- 3D Animated Background: Display an animated 3D scene in the background using React Three Fiber to create a visually appealing and immersive experience.
- Glassmorphic UI: Implement a glassmorphic design for the user interface components (sidebar, note cards) using semi-transparent background colors and backdrop blur filters.
- Bento Grid Layout: Organize notes in a responsive Bento Grid layout, optimizing the display for various screen sizes and devices.
- Real-time Note Synchronization: Enable real-time synchronization of notes across devices using Firestore's onSnapshot listener, ensuring seamless updates without manual refresh.

- AI-Powered Note Summarization: Utilize Firebase Genkit to automatically summarize note content using Gemini Pro, providing a brief overview of each note.
- Spring Physics Animations: Apply spring physics to UI interactions (hover, click) using Framer Motion, creating responsive and tactile animations that feel natural and engaging.

## Style Guidelines:

- Background: Deep zinc (#27272A) to provide a high-contrast canvas.
- Card Surface: Use a semi-transparent background color (#18181B) with backdrop-blur-md to create a glassmorphic effect.
